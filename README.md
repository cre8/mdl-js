# mDL Implementation in JavasScript (TypeScript)

This is the reference implmentation of [ISO 18013-5](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html) defines mDL (mobile Driver Licenses) specification written in TypeScript. It aims to provide a production-ready, robust and secure way to handle.

## Concepts

- Platfrom agnostic: Our library is platform agnostic and does not depend on any specific platform.
- Bring your own crypto: Our library is platfrom agnostic and does not depend on any cryptographic library. It is up to the user to provide the cryptographic library they want to use.
- Modular design: Our library is modular and can be used in different scenarios. It is up to the user to decide which features they want to use.
- TypeScript: Our library is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for the API.
- Easy to use: Our library is easy to use and provides a simple API for handling mDL data.
